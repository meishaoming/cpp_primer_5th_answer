## Exercises Section 3.2.2
### Exercise 3.2: 

Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time.Modify your program to read a word at a time.Exercise 3.3: Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the stringinput operator and in the getline function.Exercise 3.4: Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer.Exercise 3.5: Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Print the concatenated string. Next, change the program to separate adjacent input strings by a space.

If not, how might you fix it? vector<int> ivec;ivec[0] = 42;Exercise 3.19: List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements, each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why.Exercise 3.20: Read a set of integers into a vector. Print the sum of each pair of adjacent elements. Change your program so that it prints the sum of the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to- last, and so on.

## Exercises Section 3.6
### Exercise 3.43: 

> Write three different versions of a program to print the elements of ia. One version should use a range for to manage the iteration, the other two should use an ordinary for loop in one case using subscripts and in the other using pointers. In all three programs write all the types directly. That is, do not use a type alias, auto, or decltype to simplify the code.### Exercise 3.44: 

> Rewrite the programs from the previous exercises using apoints type alias for the type of the loop control variables.Exercise 3.45: Rewrite the programs again, this time using auto.
